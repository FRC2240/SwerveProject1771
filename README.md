**Welcome to Team 1771's (North Gwinnett Robotics) GitHub repo containing some updates (mainly trajectory following) for our 2020/21 Infinite Recharge "Black Widdow" robot**

*Please follow these guidelines while editing code:*
-  If classes are only used once, try making them namespaces.
-  Keep public functions & variables declared in .hpp files.
-  Private functions and variables should be kept within .cpp files.
-  Use snake_styling for variables.
-  Use camelCase for functions.
-  Use PascalCase for classes & namespaces.
-  Constant variables & namespaces containing exclusively constant variables may be ALL_UPPERCASE
-  When making .cpp files, put includes at the top, then constant variables, then normal private variables, then private function declarations/definitions, and finally public function definitions.
- When #including files, put local files in quotes at the top of the file, followed by frc libraries using angular brackets (<>), then any third-party libraries (ctre, rev, etc.) and finally put any STL libraries (array, thread, iostream, etc.) below that (seperate each section with new lines).
- Keep comments short and sweet. If you comment out a large section, either move it into a seperate .old file or simply delete it (provided it was in a previous commit, it can easily be recovered later).
- Keep lines short. If needed, use extra lines to seperate out longer function calls, ternary operations, & etc.
- Add space / extra lines wherever/whenever it helps keep the code looking less cramped.
- Alt + Shift + F is your second best friend (after Ctrl + S).
- Make commits often, but only after ensuring your code compiles.
- **Thanks for helping keep our code clean & readable for all!**
