**Welcome to Team 1771's (North Gwinnett Robotics) GitHub repo containing code for their Black Widow 2021 Infinite Recharge robot**

*Please follow this style while editing code:*
-  If classes are only used once, try making them namespaces
-  Keep public functions & variables declared in .hpp files
-  Private functions and variables should be kept within .cpp files
-  Use snake_styling for variables
-  Use camelCase for functions
-  Use PascalCase for classes & namespaces
-  Constant variables & namespaces containing exclusively constant variables may be ALL_UPPER_CASE
-  When making .cpp files, put includes at the top, then constant variables, then normal private variables, and finally function declarations
- When #including files, put local files in quotes at the top of the file, followed by frc libraries using angular brackets (<>), and finall put any STL libraries (array, thread, iostream, etc.) below that.
- Keep comments short and sweet. If you comment out a large section, either move it into a seperate .old file or simply delete it (provided it was in a previous commit, it can easily be recovered later)
